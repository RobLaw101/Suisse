Added executable fatJar to run with java -jar 

Imrpovements TODO which could not be completed due to time contraints ::::
1. introduce threading to process mutually exclusive events i.e StandardEvent & ApplicationEvent for large sizes of logfile
2. along with threading also introduce multi threaded batch inserts processing for large sizes of logfile, batch per thread with split elements from logfile etc
3. although not a TDD strategy, complete remaining unit tests
4. improve logging
